# Changes from Midterms:
- Home: Added a carrousel. Favorite movie cards, with hover on effects. Bootstrap Navbar.
- Movie Page: Added a trailer for the movie. Rating system. Like button. Other suggestions. 
- In general: Made the dropdown menu differently, by listing categories of movies instead of individual movies. 

# What Challenges I faced/Problems with the code: 
  Perhaps the most challenging aspect was getting the javascrip for the star-rating system to work. It still does not register the click of the user. That is, it does not record the stars user has selected. 
Navbar Issue: On same pages, the dropdown is not working.
[Update: It was a problem of loading javascript properly. It's fixed now.]

# What I would work on if I had more time:
I would like to make it thematically more beautiful. Improve the star-rating system.
